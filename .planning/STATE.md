## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Lenis stack confirmed (research HIGH confidence)
- [Roadmap]: Client Component islands architecture -- page.tsx stays Server Component
- [Roadmap]: CSS-only visual polish ships before GSAP complexity (Phase 3 before Phase 5)
- [Roadmap]: Micro-interactions (magnetic buttons, card tilt) are last before hardening -- highest over-animation risk
- [01-01]: Manual new Lenis() chosen over ReactLenis for direct ticker sync control
- [01-01]: SplitText registered in Phase 1 singleton to avoid future modification
- [01-01]: Smooth scroll gated on pointer:coarse AND prefers-reduced-motion
- [01-02]: Option B wrapping strategy -- AnimatedSection wraps sections without moving class names
- [01-02]: translateY(24px) contract established between CSS initial states and future GSAP from({y:24})

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [RESOLVED in 01-01]: Lenis integration pattern resolved -- manual new Lenis() chosen for direct ticker control
- [Research gap]: SplitText 3.13+ masking API shape -- verify before Phase 5
